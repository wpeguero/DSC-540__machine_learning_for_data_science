# DSC-540__machine_learning_for_data_science
This is the class where everything that has been taught in regards to machine learning algorithms as well as any implementations regarding said algorithms will be taught and it's exercises shall be stored there.

## First Project: KNN Algorithm

This algorithm uses diabetic data to classify whether a patient should be readmitted or not while assuming that the total number of clusters is 5. This assumption may have lead to a case where the accuracy of the model suffered, with an accuracy equivalent to a coin toss.
